## Legal Information

### Responsibility for Content
As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with § 7, para. 1 TMG under general law. However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obligated as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which knowledge of a specific legal violation is obtained. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal violations, I will remove this content immediately.

### Liability for Links
This app contains links to external third-party websites over whose content I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any warranty for this external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.

However, permanent content monitoring of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a legal violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove such links immediately.

### Copyright
The content and works created by me on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Reproduction, editing, distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this app are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.

Insofar as the content on this app was not created by me, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright violation, please inform me accordingly. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove such content immediately.

## Special Notes Regarding the App

### TikTok Integration
Resimply extracts information from publicly accessible TikTok videos. This app has no official connection to TikTok Ltd. or ByteDance Ltd. and does not use officially certified APIs. TikTok is a trademark of TikTok Ltd.

**Important Notice:** The app's functionality depends on the public availability of TikTok content. Changes to the TikTok platform may affect the app's functionality.

### AI-Generated Content
The app uses artificial intelligence to extract recipe information from TikTok videos. Despite careful programming, I cannot guarantee the completeness and accuracy of the extracted recipe data. Users are themselves responsible for verifying the safety and accuracy of the recipes.

### Food Safety
**Important Notice:** I assume no responsibility for health damage that could arise from using the recipes provided in the app. Users are fully responsible for:
- Checking ingredients for allergens
- Food preparation safety
- Compliance with hygiene regulations
- Proper food storage

All data is stored and processed exclusively on servers in the European Union (Germany). No transfer of personal data to third countries takes place.

## Dispute Resolution

### Consumer Dispute Resolution

### Notice according to § 36 VSBG
According to § 36 VSBG (Consumer Dispute Resolution Act), I point out that I do not participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board and am not obligated to do so.

## Liability Notice

### Private Use
Since I operate this app as a private individual, it is not subject to the same commercial liability provisions as commercial providers. Nevertheless, I strive to provide a reliable and secure service.

### Technical Availability
As an individual, I have limited resources for operating the technical infrastructure. Occasional outages or maintenance work cannot therefore be completely excluded. I will inform users in a timely manner about planned maintenance work.

## Choice of Law and Jurisdiction

German law applies to contracts between me and users, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The place of jurisdiction is Paderborn, Germany, provided the user is a merchant or has no general place of jurisdiction in Germany.
